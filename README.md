# 📝 Product Feedback App

A well-written README helps others (and your future self!) understand, use, and appreciate your project. Here’s a quick guide to writing one.

## 📌 What is a README?

A `README.md` is usually the **first** thing someone sees in your repo. It gives an **overview** of what your **project** is about, how to use it, and how it works.

You spent hours on your project — spend at least 30 minutes writing a clear README.
It’s your chance to tell the world what your hard work is all about!

## 🧹 Tips

- Don’t overthink it! Just explain your project clearly
- Use headers, bullet points, and links to keep it easy to read
- Update the README if your project changes

## ✨ Example of a README

## 🎨 Markdown Formatting Tips

README files use **Markdown** (`.md`) to style content.

### Common Markdown formatting:

```markdown
# H1 (Main title)

## H2 (Section)

### H3 (Subsection)

**bold text**  
_italic text_  
`inline code`

- bullet points

1. numbered lists

[Link text](https://example.com)
